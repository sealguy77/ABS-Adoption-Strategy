**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
The current state of CSA adoption efforts faces a fundamental barrier: decision paralysis and competing priorities. CSAs face an abundance of training and upskilling opportunities – so many that they struggle to prioritize. The real problem isn't access to knowledge; it's focus and actionability. Many CSAs are creating "power users" rather than change evangelists. They focus on technical training and a few champions, but this doesn't move the organizational needle. Without a clear, unifying methodology, adoption efforts remain fragmented and transactional. We're checking boxes, not changing how people work. This approach leads to underutilized licenses, customer dissatisfaction, and threatens renewals. Research in organizational change shows that adoption barriers are fundamentally human, not technical. We need to reframe how CSAs approach their role – from technical instructors to change leaders who guide customers through predictable stages of adoption (awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, reinforcement).

### Slide 4: The Opportunity – Connecting At Scale

**Slide Layout**: Visual diagram showing three interconnected elements
- Central visual: Three pillars or interconnected nodes flowing upward
- All narrative in speaker notes
- **USE EXISTING PRESENTATION THEME:** Match design language

**Text on Slide** (MAXIMUM 3 words):
"Connecting At Scale"

**Visual Requirements**:

- Visually connected (arrows, bridges, lines showing integration)
- Upward trend line or growth indicator
- Color: Use existing theme primary color with supporting accents
- Image size: 80% of slide

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
The opportunity is significant. By shifting our approach to adoption, we unlock customer success at a different level. "Connecting At Scale" is our framework combining three pillars: (1) Learn the Environment – using data to understand adoption gaps and create urgency; (2) Connect Human-to-Human – moving from transactions to relationships, engaging customer sponsors and managers in change conversations; (3) Enable Productive Adoption Conversations – positioning CSAs as change strategists who guide organizations through structured adoption. This approach recognizes that when people encounter change, they progress through distinct stages. They need to become aware of why change is necessary, develop desire to participate, gain knowledge, build ability through practice, and receive reinforcement to sustain change. By guiding customers through these stages strategically – rather than just pushing information – we dramatically improve adoption outcomes. The market opportunity is enormous: customers who fully adopt Microsoft solutions see 15%+ productivity improvements, $2M+ in cost savings, and higher satisfaction. For Microsoft, better adoption means higher renewal rates, expansion revenue, and stronger partnerships. This is a strategic competitive advantage.

- Each quadrant: distinct icon + progress indicator (bar, percentage, or gauge)
- Color-coded sections using existing theme colors
- Professional, clean design
- Image size: 75% of slide

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
Success is multidimensional. We're measuring four key dimensions: (1) CSA Adoption & Readiness – What percentage of CSAs have been trained in change management methodology? Target 90%+ completion in Q1. Are they confident applying the structured approach? We'll assess via quizzes and manager feedback. (2) Manager Support & Coalition – What percentage of M1s are actively championing adoption in their teams? Target 100% engagement. Are they initiating adoption conversations? Are adoption goals part of CSA performance plans? (3) Customer Adoption Outcomes – Are we seeing Monthly Active Users (MAU) increase across customer accounts where CSAs apply this approach? Target moving from baseline (e.g., 40% MAU) to 60%+ within 6 months. Are licenses being better utilized? (4) Business Impact – Are we seeing renewals improve? Are customers reporting ROI? Are we capturing documented success stories showing productivity gains, cost savings, efficiency improvements? The combination of these metrics tells us if the strategy is working end-to-end: internal mindset shift plus external customer success.

- Image size: 75% of slide

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
Structured change management research tells us that successful adoption follows a predictable journey. CSAs must understand and guide customers through five critical stages. Stage 1 – Awareness: People need to understand why change is necessary. This starts with data and facts. Within ABS, we are close to our customers, and those we are closest to in the customer space are usually technical powerhouses. They are slinging Power Platform solutions and developing cutting edge prompts, but if you look at your customer's data and really see the forest for the trees, you might see a gap in adoption in some of our products. This fact-based urgency moves people from "I didn't know this was a problem" to "I see the situation clearly." Stage 2 – Desire: Knowing about a problem doesn't create willingness to change. People need to want the change. This requires connecting change to personal and organizational benefits. A CSA helps customer leaders see how better adoption improves decision-making speed, reduces meeting time, improves employee satisfaction. We appeal to intrinsic motivation. Stage 3 – Knowledge: Once people want to change, they need to know how. This is where training comes in, but it's targeted and timed for maximum impact. Rather than generic training for everyone, we provide role-specific guidance at the moment of need. Sales teams learn how Teams accelerates pipeline management; finance teams learn how Power BI improves reporting efficiency. Stage 4 – Ability: Knowledge isn't enough; people need practice and reinforcement to build confidence and competence. Champions, peer support, and ongoing coaching are critical. A customer's first attempt at using a new process feels awkward – like writing with your non-dominant hand. Through repeated practice with support, the new behavior becomes natural and efficient. Stage 5 – Reinforcement: Once people are using new tools effectively, they need ongoing reinforcement to sustain change and prevent regression. This includes celebrating successes, recognizing early adopters, measuring progress, maintaining communication about benefits being realized. Without reinforcement, people often drift back to old habits. CSAs who understand this journey can diagnose where adoption is stalling and apply the right intervention. If adoption is low due to lack of awareness, training won't help – you need better communication of the business case. If desire is the barrier, you need to address concerns and build leadership sponsorship. This diagnostic capability transforms CSAs into true change strategists.

### Slide 7: Three Pillars of Connecting At Scale

**Slide Layout**: Three vertical or horizontal pillars
- Three distinct pillar shapes with unique icons
- Connecting elements between pillars
- Labels only (one word each)
- **USE EXISTING PRESENTATION THEME:** Match pillar styling and colors

**Text on Slide** (MAXIMUM 3 words):
"Learn | Connect | Enable"

**Visual Requirements**:

- Visual bridges or connections between pillars
- Each pillar: use existing theme color palette
- Solid, stable visual impression
- Image size: 80% of slide

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
The Connecting At Scale framework rests on three pillars, each addressing a different aspect of adoption success. Pillar 1: Learn the Environment. CSAs start by analyzing customer data – usage metrics, adoption gaps, competitive risk. By establishing a fact base, we create the awareness necessary for change. For example, a CSA might discover that Teams has only 30% monthly active users in a customer's organization while SharePoint is even lower. This data becomes the conversation starter that helps customer leaders recognize the situation clearly. Pillar 2: Connect Human-to-Human. Rather than pushing training, CSAs engage in strategic conversations with customer sponsors, C-suite, and managers. We help them understand the adoption challenge as a people issue. We use exercises (like the non-dominant hand exercise) to viscerally demonstrate how change feels uncomfortable initially, building empathy and leadership sponsorship. These conversations build desire – helping leaders want to champion the change in their organization. Pillar 3: Enable Productive Adoption Conversations. CSAs shift from technical instructor to change strategist. They develop tailored adoption plans with customer teams – identifying champions, coaching managers on how to guide their teams through each stage of the change journey, setting up feedback loops, establishing success metrics. The CSA collaborates with the customer's project team to create a communication campaign about new ways of working, building knowledge and ability across the organization. By combining data insights, human engagement, and strategic planning, CSAs drive adoption that sticks.

- Image size: 85% of slide

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
This slide illustrates the fundamental mindset shift. Before: CSAs are positioned as product experts who deliver training and identify power users. They focus on technical features and skill-building. While well-intentioned, this approach is transactional – it doesn't drive organizational change. After: CSAs become change catalysts who understand organizational dynamics, can diagnose adoption barriers across the five stages of change, and lead holistic adoption initiatives. They're trusted advisors who help customers navigate the human side of technology adoption. The new CSA role includes competencies like: diagnosing where adoption is stalling (awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, or reinforcement gaps), coaching managers and leaders on how to sponsor change effectively, designing communication and engagement strategies tailored to different stakeholder groups, measuring progress through multiple dimensions, celebrating outcomes to sustain momentum. This isn't about replacing technical skills – CSAs need those. It's about elevating their impact from individuals learning a tool to organizations transforming their way of working. Research shows that CSAs who master change leadership are more valued, see higher customer satisfaction, drive renewals, and often move into leadership roles themselves. The transformation is both a skillset upgrade and a confidence/mindset shift – CSAs go from "I teach tools" to "I drive organizational success."

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
Our mission crystallizes the strategy's intent. We are empowering CSAs to be change catalysts – individuals who spark and lead organizational transformation. This isn't about adding training; it's about redefining the CSA value proposition. The mission commits us to a people-centric approach, recognizing that adoption barriers are human, not technical. We're shifting from a training mindset (where success = completion) to a change management mindset (where success = organizational transformation and business outcomes). By "enterprise-wide adoption," we emphasize that we're not creating pockets of expertise – we're changing how entire organizations work with Microsoft tools, guided through each stage of the change journey with intentional strategy. And critically, we tie success to tangible business value: productivity gains, cost savings, ROI realization, customer satisfaction, renewals. This mission aligns with Microsoft's corporate strategy (digital transformation for customers) and our business imperative (drive adoption to ensure renewals and expansion). Every CSA should be able to articulate this mission and see themselves in it. Every manager should reinforce it. Every customer should feel its impact.

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
We're rolling out this strategy in four phases, each building on the previous. This phased approach ensures every stakeholder tier is engaged and the strategy is tested before full-scale rollout. Each phase moves stakeholders through the same change journey we guide customers through – building awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement. Phase 1: Leadership Alignment & Sponsorship. Secure M2 executive buy-in. Brief senior leaders on the strategy and its business importance using data (adoption equals renewals). An executive sponsor is designated. We form a steering committee of M2s to guide strategy, allocate resources, and remove roadblocks. This phase builds organizational awareness of the change imperative. Timeline: Weeks 1-4. Phase 2: Manager (M1) Enablement & Coalition. Equip M1 managers with change management principles and tools. M1s become the communication and coaching frontline. Each M1 onboards their team into the program – scheduling training, discussing adoption goals in team meetings, identifying potential champions. Build a coalition of enthusiastic, conversant managers who can guide their CSAs through the change journey. Timeline: Weeks 5-8. Phase 3: CSA Training & Cultural Shift. Roll out CSA-specific "Adoption & Change Management 101" training. Interactive, role-specific, with tools and practical frameworks for guiding customers through each stage of change. Launch a CSA community of practice (Teams channel) for peer learning and support. By end of Phase 3, the CSA role definition expands to include "driving organizational change." Timeline: Weeks 9-14. Phase 4: Pilot Engagements & Scaling. Identify pilot customer accounts. Trained CSAs, with M1 support, apply the new approach. Measure results and celebrate wins internally. Use success stories in communications. After pilots succeed, transition to full-scale rollout – all CSAs incorporate Connecting At Scale practices into account plans. Timeline: Weeks 15+.

- Image size: 75% of slide

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
To overcome the main barrier (competing priorities and lack of time), we deploy five high-impact engagement tactics, all grounded in behavioral science and organizational change best practices. Tactic 1: Manager & Sponsor-Led Campaign. Middle managers (M1s) act as change sponsors in their teams, regularly talking about adoption priorities. We equip them with ready-to-send communications (email templates, slide decks). M2s host periodic "Adoption Town Halls" to reinforce top-down support. Research shows managers account for 70% of variance in team engagement – so when CSAs see their own leaders prioritizing adoption, they recognize it as important, not a fad. This visible sponsorship moves people from lack of awareness to clear understanding of what's being asked. Tactic 2: Communicate the "Why" & WIIFM. All engagement content starts with clear purpose – the business case and personal value. For CSAs: "This approach will help you deliver greater customer impact and be recognized for strategic leadership." For managers: "This will improve team results and customer satisfaction scores, directly tying to business success." We use compelling storytelling – real cases where change management made the difference – to build desire. Every communication highlights concrete value (ROI, time savings) to demonstrate the change is worth the effort. Tactic 3: Interactive Two-Way Engagement. We hold regular open forums and Q&A sessions (monthly "Adoption Clinics") where CSAs voice concerns and share experiences. Leaders listen and respond transparently, addressing fears and incorporating suggestions. We set up a community chat (Teams) for ongoing discussion, so engagement is continuous. This human-centric approach makes CSAs feel heard and valued, increasing willingness to participate. Tactic 4: Success Stories & Recognition. We highlight early adopters and teams exemplifying the Connecting At Scale mindset. Following the "progress principle" from psychology, we share milestones: "In Q1, 50 CSAs achieved Prosci certification." We implement "Adoption Champion of the Month" recognition with rewards. Recognition boosts morale and signals that management values adoption efforts. Tactic 5: Targeted Training & Gamification. Instead of long generic trainings, we offer bite-sized, role-specific learning modules (micro-learnings and videos). We use gamification: adoption hackathons or innovation challenges where CSAs team up competitively. Points, digital badges, and progress dashboards introduce friendly competition. By making learning fun and rewarding, we drive sustained involvement.

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
Our strategy drives tangible business value for customers and Microsoft across multiple dimensions. PRU (Purchasing Related Unit): Improved adoption unlocks expanded opportunity visibility. When customers are actively using Microsoft tools, CSAs can identify new use cases and expansion opportunities. Usage data becomes a conversation starter for upsell. MAU (Monthly Active Users): One of the most critical health metrics. By applying Connecting At Scale, we see MAU increase – for example, Teams from 40% to 60%+ in 6 months. Higher MAU indicates real adoption and engagement. ROI – Quantifiable Business Outcomes: Customers realize tangible ROI from Microsoft solutions. For example, after full Teams adoption, one customer reported 30% email volume reduction (time savings), 50% faster project delivery (with Power BI dashboards), and $2M in cost savings from consolidating legacy systems. These outcomes are directly tied to adoption depth and breadth. Customer Success – Satisfaction & Renewals: When customers achieve adoption and see ROI, satisfaction rises. Net Promoter Scores improve. More importantly, renewal rates increase – customers with high adoption are unlikely to churn. Our strategy directly impacts renewal likelihood. BRAC – Better Resource Allocation & Cost Efficiency: Adoption efforts reduce the need for ongoing support and training. Mature adoption means customers can self-support and spread knowledge peer-to-peer. This is more efficient than continuous formal training. License Optimization – Upgrading Underutilized Licenses: As adoption deepens, customers realize the value in their licenses and upgrade. For example, a customer initially buying a limited number of Power BI licenses might expand once they see adoption-driven ROI. This drives expansion revenue.

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
Let me illustrate the transformative power of Connecting At Scale with a real scenario. BEFORE (Traditional Approach): A CSA was tasked with improving Power Platform adoption at a large enterprise client. They set up product trainings and identified a few "power users" in various departments. While these efforts built pockets of expertise, overall usage stagnated at about 20% of employees. Many resisted switching from legacy systems. Customer middle managers viewed training as a checkbox activity. Leadership wasn't involved. The new platform remained underutilized, the customer questioned ROI on licenses, and renewal was at risk. AFTER (Connecting At Scale Approach): The CSA reframed the engagement as a holistic change initiative. Learn the Environment: The CSA analyzed the customer's environment and data, identifying Teams and SharePoint usage gaps by division. By establishing a fact base, the CSA created urgency and a clear baseline. Connect Human-to-Human: The CSA convened strategic conversations with customer leadership and key managers, discussing organizational adoption challenges (not just features). Through discussion and exercises illustrating resistance, the CSA helped leaders recognize adoption as a people issue requiring their sponsorship. The customer's CIO and department heads agreed to champion the change, communicating support and allocating time for learning. Enable Productive Adoption Conversations: The CSA became a change strategist, collaborating with the customer to develop a tailored adoption plan: establish an internal champion network, coach managers on ADKAR, set up feedback channels, plan reinforcement activities. The CSA guided stakeholder mapping and communication campaign development. IMPACT: Within several months, adoption surged from 20% to 80%+ of employees. Executive sponsorship proved transformational – managers integrated new tools into daily workflows and team goals. The champion network created peer support. Executives logged dozens of hours monthly (up from near-zero). The company realized efficiency gains: faster decision-making, improved collaboration, consolidated legacy systems. They reported 15% productivity improvement and $2M in cost savings. The customer opted not only to renew but to expand licenses, citing clear value realized. This CSA's success exemplifies that treating adoption as change management (with data, leadership, champions, and reinforcement) transforms technology investment into organizational transformation – benefiting both customer and Microsoft.

### Slide 14: Critical Success Factors – What Needs to Happen

**Slide Layout**: 5 factors with visual hierarchy
- Five distinct icons/elements
- Relative importance shown through size or intensity
- Arrangement: Linear, pyramid, or circular
- **USE EXISTING PRESENTATION THEME:** Match styling and color scheme

**Text on Slide** (MAXIMUM 5 words – one per factor):
"Sponsorship | Manager Support | CSA Skills | Readiness | Measurement"

**Visual Requirements**:
- Five distinct icons (crown, coach, skill badge, handshake, meter)
- Visual hierarchy showing importance using existing theme styling
- Optional: Visual connections showing interdependencies
- Professional, clear design
- Image size: 75% of slide

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
For this strategy to succeed, five critical success factors must be in place. 1. Executive Sponsorship: The M2 steering committee must be genuinely committed and visibly supportive. They allocate resources, remove roadblocks, and reinforce the strategy in executive forums. Without top-level buy-in, the initiative becomes an L&D afterthought. 2. Manager (M1) Enablement & Support: Managers are the linchpin. They must understand the strategy, have tools and messaging to cascade it, and be accountable for their team's adoption. If managers don't champion the work, CSAs won't prioritize it. We must invest heavily in M1 workshops and ongoing coaching. 3. CSA Capability & Confidence: CSAs must be trained, equipped with tools (ADKAR templates, communication plans, assessment frameworks), and feel confident in their new role as change strategists. If training is generic or insufficient, CSAs won't apply the approach. We need interactive, role-specific, hands-on training. 4. Customer Organizational Readiness: Customers must be willing partners. The best adoption strategies fail if customers don't have executive sponsorship or are too overwhelmed to engage. We may need to be selective in initial engagements, choosing customers with receptive leadership and bandwidth. 5. Robust Measurement & Feedback: We must measure success transparently and adjust accordingly. By tracking CSA training completion, manager engagement, customer MAU trends, and business outcomes, we get real-time feedback on what's working. This data also helps us celebrate wins and maintain momentum.

**Speaker Notes** (Add to Notes pane):
The opportunity before us is significant. By shifting from transactional training to strategic organizational change management, we can transform how CSAs drive customer success. We can move from isolated power users to enterprise-wide adoption that yields real business value – productivity gains, cost savings, renewals, expansion. This strategy is grounded in proven change frameworks (ADKAR, Kotter) and Microsoft's internal successes. It acknowledges the real barriers (decision paralysis, competing priorities) and deploys targeted tactics to overcome them. Most importantly, it positions our CSAs as strategic leaders – trusted advisors who help customers navigate organizational transformation. Here's what we're asking: Executive & Steering Committee – Commit to the four-phase rollout. Allocate resources and visibly champion the strategy. Managers (M1s & M2s) – Actively engage your teams. Communicate the "why," model the new approach, hold your CSAs accountable for adoption work. CSAs – Embrace your new role as change catalysts. Attend training, apply the methodology, share your learnings with peers. All of Us – Measure success transparently, celebrate wins, and continuously improve. The timeline is ambitious but achievable. The business case is compelling. The path is clear. Let's move forward together to transform adoption and deliver unprecedented value to our customers and Microsoft. The time to start is now.
