## 🎯 Overview

### The Challenge
CSAs face **decision paralysis** and **competing priorities**. An abundance of training and upskilling opportunities creates confusion about what to prioritize. Current approaches create "power users" rather than organizational "change evangelists," leaving adoption fragmented and transactional.

### The Opportunity
**"Connecting At Scale"** reframes adoption from training-focused to change-management-focused. By combining data-driven insights, human engagement, and strategic planning, CSAs can drive enterprise-wide adoption that yields measurable ROI, improved customer satisfaction, and higher renewal rates.

### The Mission
Shift from transactional training to **people-centric change management** that drives enterprise-wide adoption and delivers tangible business value.

## 💡 Key Insights

> **The real constraint is not training availability—it's mindset and engagement.** Getting CSAs and managers to prioritize adoption-focused initiatives requires reframing adoption as strategic organizational change, not compliance training.

> **Adoption barriers are fundamentally human, not technical.** Research shows that successful adoption follows a predictable journey through five stages (ADKAR). CSAs who understand this journey can diagnose where adoption is stalling and apply the right intervention at the right time.

> **Managers drive 70% of team engagement variance.** Visible managerial sponsorship is the single most important factor in whether adoption initiatives succeed or fail.
